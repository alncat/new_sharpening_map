This is a small program to generate a new type of sharpening electron density map.
It is developed on phenix-1.9-1692. To use this program, you need to copy 
__init__.py to cctbx_project/mmtbx/maps/, map_tools.py to cctbx_project/mmtbx/. 
This folder also contains a sample input file -- map.params.
